          <p class="bigger"> Malt is a journal showcasing the creative activity of older adults in the St. Louis community. The journal's primary mission is to positively influence and enrich the older adult community. We act as a bridge between older adults in the St. Louis community and students at Washington University.</p>

              <h3>About the project</h3>
                <h4>The theme of the semester was the older adult community.</h4>

              <h4>How might we?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>provide a resource that requires older humans to continue to think creatively/problem solve?</li>
                  <li>make older humans feel engaged with their community?</li>
                  <li>create a method to help older humans be more creative with the goal of improving mental health and sense of purpose?</li>
                  <li>create an outlet for creative seniors?</li>
                  <li>funnel creativity in a way that allows older humans to be creative within their means/interests?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our process</h3>
                  <p>Throughout the fall 2015 semester, we interviewed a wide variety of older adults: those who were physically healthy to those who had to change their lifestyles based on handicaps, lifelong creatives to new artists, our own grandparents to local residents. My team and I visited multiple older adult activity centers around St. Louis, such as the Shephard Center and the Lifelong Learning Institute. We interviewed several older adults about their activites, their interests, and the sorts of classes they were taking or would like to take. All of them were thrilled at the idea that college students were interested talking to them, much less seeing the work they were producing. We really wanted to bring the wisdom of these adults to other people.</p>
                  <p>We identified various participants in the different aspects of the magazine, creating user profiles for both the contributing adults and the students involved in making the magazine.</p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Subscription to weekly/monthly art/literature/etc. magazine where older humans could create and submit their work to be featured. In the format of traditional art/poetry magazines. No ads, no promotions, just meant to feature the work of older humans. The work should be a wide range, from  art to poetry to home improvement to community projects, etc.</li>
                    <li>Monthly subscription to DIY journal</li>
                    <li>Design For America for the elderly, to get them involved in their community. specifically focused on local projects, get them involved and solving real problems</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="right">
                <div class="spacer hide_me"></div>
                <h3>Our solution</h3>
                  <p>We landed on the idea of a magazine, to be published bi-annually, as the most effective method of displaying work. It is published both in limited print editions and online.</p>
                  <p>For each issue, we aim to gather a variety of different forms of creativity from members of the community, whether that be through traditional "art" such as painting , drawing, or photography, poetry or prose, or knitting, gardening, or cooking. We don't want to limit what creativity means to anyone.</p>
                  <p>It is inspiring for everyone to see the amazing things their friends are making and a source of pride for them to be published in a tangible object. Additionally, we hope for Malt Journal to become a project that will carry on even after its founders have graduated, so we can continue forging valuable relationships with a demographic we otherwise may never have had the chance.</p>
