          <h2>Design For America</h2>
            <p>Design For America is a student group that aims to tackle real world problems through human-centered design thinking. The WashU Studio is divided into teams of five or six students, and each semester, a topic is provided. Through user research, each group identifies an issue within that topic and come up with a creative solution to that problem. Topics are often relevant to better understanding the community at large and each group must work with a community group throughout the semester.</p>
            <p>The goal of each semester is to be ready to prototype the solution and possibly move to implementation during the next semester. I have been a part of Design For America since August 2014 and am currently working on two teams that have reached implementation.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>Cubic is a student-run platform that connects WashU students with summer storage needs to residents off campus with spare basement space.</p>
            <h3>About the project:</h3>
              <p>The theme of the semester was upcycling. We focused our attention on how we could be more efficient with move-in and move-out on campus, create less waste, and foster a community between students at Washington University and residents in the surrounding neighborhood.
              <p>Cubic provides a simple system for students to find a low-cost alternative to overpriced storage companies, and a means for homeowners to make some extra money with space they aren’t otherwise using. Cubic provides all the resources necessary to facilitate an efficient and fair process between student and resident, but allows the users to arrange their own individualized agreement.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p> Malt is a journal showcasing the creative activity of older adults in the St. Louis community. The journal's primary mission is to positively influence and enrich the older adult community. We act a bridge between older adults in the St. Louis community and students at Washington University.</p>
            <h3>About the project:</h3>
              <p>The theme of the semester was the older adult community. We focused on the idea of creativity and how we could help and inspire older adults to continue making things (in all sense of the word) even after they are retired. With the idea that when you are a kid and you are featured in the newspaper in mind, we founded Malt as a way for older adults to be able to show off their creative endeavors.</p>
