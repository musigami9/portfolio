            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>Cubic is a student-run platform that connects WashU students with summer storage needs to residents off campus with spare basement space.</p>
            <h3>About the project</h3>
              <h4>The topic:</h4>
                <p>The theme of the semester was upcycling.</p>

              <h4>How might we?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>make it more efficient for students and those coordinating it?</li>
                  <li>funnel typically non-recyclable materials out of the “WashU bubble” towards people or groups who need it or can repurpose it?</li>
                  <li>upcycle materials that are often wasted but in adequate condition?</li>
                  <li>organize and streamline the exchange of goods between WashU students and members of the St. Louis community during move-in and move-out?</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                <h3>Our process</h3>
                  <p>Along the topic of upcycling, we first thought about how much waste is created during the move in and move out periods before and after semesters. Other services exist around campus, such as UTrucking and The Trading Post, but they are either under-utilized or  too expensive.</p>
                  <p>We conducted several surveys to gauge interest and assess the needs of WashU students. We found, through surveying RA's on the South 40 (WashU's undergraduate living complex) that the most wasted items were excess school materials, cardboard from packaging, electronics, toiletries and other large room decor, and clothing.</p>
                  <p> Our main goal became to find a way to eliminate waste between semesters and give students a cheaper option than public storage or competitors while also connecting to residents in the neighborhoods surrounding WashU.</p>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make move in/move out process more streamlined with less waste and expense.</li>
                    <li>Give students control over where their items go.</li>
                    <li>Payment.</li>
                    <li>Insure security of items both financially and against accidental damage.</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="left">
                <h3>Our solution</h3>
                  <p>We created Cubic as a website with functioning similar to AirBNB, for students to connect with residents around WashU. Students have the freedom to choose which residents they want to store with, and residents list their homes with general locations and basement sizes.</p>
                  <p>In orer to give the most control to those involved, Cubic takes a hands-off approach to interactions and largely leaves it up to the resident and student to work out pricing and drop-off/pick-up details.</p>
                  <p>We are constantly working to improve the platform and address new issues as they arise, including security (eg. how students can insure their items are untampered and how residents can insure recieving their payment), monetary payment (eg. does Cubic take a cut from the transactions? Do we build an exchange service or merely suggest already existing ones such as Venmo for payment?), etc.</p>
                  <p>Having established Cubic as a ready-to-use platform during the move-out before the summer of 2016, we worked during the semester to gain feedback through surveys by the students and residents who had used it and improve for the next summer.</p>
